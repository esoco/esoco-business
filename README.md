The business framework is a foundation for process-oriented applications with a persistent back-end. Based on [ObjectRelations](https://esoco.github.io/objectrelations/) and the other frameworks of [SDACK](https://esoco.github.io/sdack/) it features classes to model and persist business data entities and to define processes that create and modify business data. Processes can also perform interactions through application-specific user interfaces to query and present data to an application user.
