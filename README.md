# The esoco-business project

The business framework is the foundation for business-related applications. Based on the ObjectRelations and the storage frameworks it features classes to model and persist business data and to define processes that create and modify business data. Processes can also perform interactions through application-specific user interfaces to query and present data to an application user. Besides processes another central element of the business framework are entities which represent a generic base to define persistent business data objects. Entities make the modeling of persistent data easy and even provide a simple way to integrate existing databases into a new software project that uses the esoco frameworks.
